# In this mode the Recursor acts as a “security aware, non-validating”
# nameserver, meaning it will set the DO-bit on outgoing queries and will
# provide DNSSEC related RRsets (NSEC, RRSIG) to clients that ask for them (by
# means of a DO-bit in the query), except for zones provided through the
# auth-zones setting. It will not do any validation in this mode, not even when
# requested by the client.
# The default mode until PowerDNS Recursor 4.5.0.
